# MCP

Otari lets `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, and `/v1/responses` use
tools exposed by MCP servers.

Add MCP as a top-level request field, not a `tools` entry.

Use either or both of:

- `mcp_servers`: inline MCP server configs the gateway should connect to directly
- `mcp_server_ids`: ids of MCP servers your workspace has configured

Otari resolves `mcp_server_ids` first and appends the resulting server configs
to any inline `mcp_servers`. Where it resolves them depends on the mode:
standalone reads the servers the workspace configured on this gateway, hybrid
resolves them through otari.ai.

When the model emits an MCP tool call, Otari:

- executes it
- appends the tool result to the conversation
- calls the model again

The loop stops when the model returns a normal assistant response or hits
`max_tool_iterations`.

## Inline MCP servers

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "List open issues in mozilla-ai/otari"}],
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "github",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/github",
      "authorization_token": "ghp_...",
      "purpose_hint": "Use for repository and issue lookups",
      "allowed_tools": ["list_issues", "get_issue"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name`: label for the server
- `url`: streamable HTTP MCP endpoint, reachable from the gateway
- `authorization_token`: optional bearer token; when set, the `url` must use `https://`
- `purpose_hint`: optional hint Otari prepends to the system message to help the model choose the tool
- `allowed_tools`: optional allow-list; only these tools are exposed from that server

## Workspace-scoped servers

Reference servers your workspace has configured by id, instead of inlining
their configs:

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the open PRs"}],
  "mcp_server_ids": ["11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"]
}
```

The workspace is the one your API key belongs to; it is never read from a
header. An id that names no server in that workspace returns `404`, and a
server that is configured but disabled is skipped rather than refusing the
request.

### Configuring them (standalone)

Manage a workspace's servers with the master key, under
`/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/mcp-servers`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/mcp-servers \
  -H "Otari-Key: $OTARI_MASTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "name": "github",
        "url": "https://mcp.example.com/github",
        "authorization_token": "ghp_...",
        "purpose_hint": "Use for repository and issue lookups",
        "allowed_tools": ["list_issues", "get_issue"]
      }'
```

`GET` lists them, `PATCH /{server_id}` updates one, and `DELETE /{server_id}`
removes it. Every operation, including the list, needs an organization
owner/admin or an owner/admin of that workspace.

- The `authorization_token` is encrypted at rest with `OTARI_SECRET_KEY` and is
  never returned. Responses carry `has_token` instead. On a `PATCH`, omit the
  field to leave the stored token alone, send `""` to clear it, or send a value
  to rotate it.
- `name` is unique within a workspace; a duplicate is refused with `409`.
- `enabled: false` keeps the row and its token but takes the server out of
  every request that names it.
- The URL is checked for SSRF safety when it is stored as well as when a
  request uses it, and must be `https://` when a token is set.
- A workspace may configure up to 50 servers.

In hybrid mode these routes are not mounted: the servers live in otari.ai and
are managed there.

## Limits and safety

- `mcp_servers` and `mcp_server_ids` cannot be combined with `otari_code_execution` or `otari_web_search` in the same request yet
- `max_tool_iterations` optionally caps the loop; default is `10`, max is `25`
- `mcp_server_ids` accepts at most 50 ids, which is also the most servers a workspace can have
- MCP URLs are validated to reduce SSRF risk; by default, private and reserved addresses are blocked, loopback is allowed, and `http://` is rejected when `authorization_token` is present
- `OTARI_MCP_ALLOW_LOOPBACK=false` disables loopback; `OTARI_MCP_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true` relaxes the private-host restriction

[Hybrid-mode protocol](hybrid-mode-protocol.md).
